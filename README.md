# Honor Badges

 Many people cannot imagine their open source work being used in unwanted or criminal ways. While these badges may not legally prevent them from using your work, it will let people know you stand opposed to your work being used to harm others.

## Why I built this
Lately there's been a lot of controversy surrounding Crypto and NFTs. I recently began investigating the legality of a crypto company indirectly using an open-source project for profit. For example, tokenizing an A.I. image generation, using an open-source project, is quite the grey area. Either way, I just really wanted to take a more affirmative stand on my beliefs on how and why people should be using whatever I may create. There might be others who feel the same way.
